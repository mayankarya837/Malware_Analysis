Static Analysis Tools :- 

PeStudio - To view suspicious files with the imports and the resources

Strings - To examine and extract ASCII and Unicode strings in binary data
           To get a high-level overview of malware capacity

Dependency Walker - To scan a file and show the libraries and imported functions
                    To display the dependences of the file

Exeinfo PE - To identify if the malware is packed with known packers

Dynamic Ananlysis Tools :- 

Process Explorer ( procExc ) - To display information about which handles and processes have been opened or loaded
                               To access information about processes running on a machine
                               To analyze processes and determine if anything is malicious

Process Monitor (procMon) - To monitor and capture the Windows file system, registry, and process activity in real time
                            To demonstrate how programs use files and DLLs and to detect errors in device files

Autoruns - To list as many auto-starting locations as possible
           To display the programs configured to run during system bootup or login


PsExec - To perform maintenance tasks by running commands on remote hosts
          To launch interactive command prompts on remote systems and remotely enable software
This tool is used by system administrators for remote script execution, such as setup script for data collection. 
It’s also been used for software deployment, although there are significantly better tools available for this task.
PsExec can be used to remotely control a machine by providing the target host's address, a valid user, and a password.
PSEXESVC is a wrapper for the service. It runs the specified executable on the remote system while using named pipes to 
redirect the process's input and output between the hosts.
A named pipe is a means of interprocess communication. Different types of pipes are commonly found in Windows Active Directory domains.
Pipes may be called for specific purposes. For example, a pipe for PsExec communication may be named \\.\pipe\psexesvc.


Regshot - To perform before-and-after snapshots of the Windows registry
          To identify any changes made to the registry by malware
          To reveal more about the malware’s capabilities and identify any additional files dropped or other IoCs
Using this tool involves a few simple steps:
Take a snapshot of the system’s registry now.
Run the malware and wait for it to finish making any system changes.
Take a snapshot of the system’s registry again.
Compare the two snapshots.



ProcDOT - To allow visual malware analysis
          To quickly determine what a malware type does
Here are the steps for using ProcDOT:
Start Process Monitor and configure the Columns fields to be compatible with ProcDOT.
Start Wireshark and start capturing traffic.
Run the malware.
Stop the Wireshark capture and export the traffic into PCAP.
Stop the Process Monitor capture and export the results into CSV.
Execute ProcDOT and import the Process Monitor and PCAP data.
Select the process and render the analysis.
Run through the animation to understand the timing of the events.



TCPView - To display detailed listings of all TCP and UDP endpoints on the system
          To enumerate all active TCP and UDP endpoints and resolve all the IP addresses to their domain name versions
